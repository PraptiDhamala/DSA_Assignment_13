Dijstra's algorithm is used to determine the shortest path from a given source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights. The graph is represented using an adjacency matrix where each cell stores the weight of the edge between two vertices. The algorithm maintains a distance array to track processed vertices. In each iteration, the unvisited vertex with the smallest distance is selected, marked as visted, and the distance of its adjacent vertices are updated if a shorther path is found. This process continues until all vertices are visited, reulting in the shortest path from the source code.
