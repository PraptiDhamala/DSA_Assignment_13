We crreate stack to hold the operators we encountered in the process. We create a string variable that will hold our postfix expression and we start moving from left to right. We concatenate it to the postfix string. When we encounter an operator, keep an account of precendence of operator. If stack is empty or have lower precedence then push the operator in stack if not pop it. At the end of expression, pop every element from stack and if there is any and concatenate them and we will have our expression.
